In corpus linguistics a hapax legomenon also or pl hapax legomena sometimes abbreviated to hapax plural hapaxes is a word or an expression that occurs only once within a context either in the written record of an entire language in the works of an author or in a single text The term is sometimes incorrectly used to describe a word that occurs in just one of an author's works but more than once in that particular work Hapax legomenon is a transliteration of Greek meaning being said

The related terms dis legomenon tris legomenon and tetrakis legomenon respectively refer to double triple or quadruple occurrences but are far less commonly used

Hapax legomena are quite common as predicted by Zipf's which states that the frequency of any word in a corpus is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table For large corpora about to of the words are hapax legomena and another to are dis Thus in the Brown Corpus of American English about half of the distinct words are hapax legomena within that

Hapax legomenon refers to the appearance of a word or an expression in a body of text not to either its origin or its prevalence in speech It thus differs from a nonce word which may never be recorded may find currency and may be widely recorded or may appear several times in the work which coins it and so on

Significance


Hapax legomena in ancient texts are usually difficult to decipher since it is easier to infer meaning from multiple contexts than from just one For example many of the remaining undeciphered Mayan glyphs are hapax legomena and Biblical particularly Hebrew see Hebrew examples hapax legomena sometimes pose problems in translation Hapax legomena also pose challenges in natural language

Some scholars consider Hapax legomena useful in determining the authorship of written works P N Harrison in The Problem of the Pastoral Epistles made hapax legomena popular among Bible scholars when he argued that there are considerably more of them in the three Pastoral Epistles than in other Pauline Epistles He argued that the number of hapax legomena in a putative author's corpus indicates his or her vocabulary and is characteristic of the author as an individual

Harrison's theory has faded in significance due to a number of problems raised by other scholars For example in W P Workman found the following numbers of hapax legomena in each Pauline Epistle

Pauline legomena

First Epistle to the
Second Epistle to the

At first glance the last three totals for the Pastoral Epistles are not out of line with the To take account of the varying length of the epistles Workman also calculated the average number of hapax legomena per page of the Greek text which ranged from to as summarized in the diagram on the Although the Pastoral Epistles have more hapax legomena per page Workman found the differences to be moderate in comparison to the variation among other Epistles This was reinforced when Workman looked at several plays by Shakespeare which showed similar variations from to per page of Irving's edition as summarized in the second diagram on the

Apart from author identity there are several other factors that can explain the number of hapax legomena in a

text length this directly affects the expected number and percentage of hapax legomena the brevity of the Pastoral Epistles also makes any statistical analysis problematic
text topic if the author writes on different subjects of course many words will occur only in limited contexts
text audience if the author is writing to a peer rather than a student or their spouse rather than their employer again quite different vocabulary will appear
time over the course of years both the language and an author's knowledge and use of language will change
In the particular case of the Pastoral Epistles all of these variables are quite different from those in the rest of the Pauline corpus and hapax legomena are no longer widely accepted as strong indicators of authorship although the authorship of the Pastorals is subject to debate on other

There are also subjective questions over whether two forms amount to the same word dog vs dogs clue vs clueless sign vs signature many other gray cases also arise The Jewish Encyclopedia points out that although there are hapaxes in the Hebrew Bible only about are not obviously related to other attested word

It would not be especially difficult for a forger to construct a work with any percentage of hapax legomena desired However it seems unlikely that forgers much before the century would have conceived such a ploy much less thought it worth the

A final difficulty with the use of hapax legomena for authorship determination is that there is considerable variation among works known to be by a single author and disparate authors often show similar values In other words hapax legomena are not a reliable indicator Authorship studies now usually use a wide range of measures to look for patterns rather than relying upon single measurements

Computer science
In the fields of computational linguistics and natural language processing NLP esp corpus linguistics and NLP it is common to disregard hapax legomena and sometimes other infrequent words as they are likely to have little value for computational techniques This disregard has the added benefit of significantly reducing the memory use of an application since by Zipf's law many words are hapax

Chinese and Japanese characters
See also Chinese characters Rare and complex characters
Classical Chinese and Japanese literature contains many Chinese characters that feature only once in the corpus and their meaning and pronunciation has often been lost Known in Japanese as kogo literally lonely characters these can be considered a type of hapax For example the Classic of Poetry BC uses the character exactly once in the verse and it was only through the discovery of a description by Guo Pu AD that the character could be associated with a specific type of ancient flute
